# TypeScript-Summernote
TypeScript definition for summernote ( http://summernote.org )

# Info
There was no TypeScript definition file for summernote yet, so I created one.
It still needs work but it allowed me already to build my TypeScript .ts files.

Summernote api is available via: http://summernote.org/deep-dive/#api

update: A npm package was created: https://www.npmjs.com/package/summernote-typescript 

Needs more help!

# Note
Any help is welcome!
